0.  pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in this problem set's dictionary. It is also fun to pronounce.
1.  Returns resource usage measures for its parameter 'who'
2.  16
3.  Because C requires passing structs by reference in functions, because by value, the size would be too big
4.  Speller.c reads words from the file, character by character, using a for loop to begin reading the first character of 
    the file, incrementing by one character until it reaches the end of the file. If the character is a letter or apostrophe,
    it is added to a word. If the word becomes larger than what we have defined as the largest word possible, the word is
    ignored. If the word has a digit, it is ignored as well.
    
    If a word still exists, it is counted, checked for spelling, and printed. The amount of time it takes to complete the
    checking is logged in ti_check.    
5.  To be able to account for numerical inputs and other punctuation which we have deemed invalid.
6.  Because word LENGTH and DICTIONARY are # declared as constants (word is an array of LENGTH+1)
7.  Hash table with linked lists. My hash table size is 1024, and each node in my linked list contains a word less than size 46,
    and a pointer to another node (or to Null to indicate the end of the linked list).
8.  Actually very fast. The problem was not with the speed of my code the first time I got it working; the problem was getting my
    code working :)
9.  None. I actually just needed to get it working, but I was optimizing at each stage of writing the code, so by the time it
    finally compiled correctly, it was very fast.
10. I don't think it is perfectly distributed through my hash table. With further dictionary analysis and dictionary processing, I
    believe I could make it even faster.
